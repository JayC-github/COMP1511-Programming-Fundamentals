# COMP1511-19T1

Hey everyone,
I'm Jay and currently doing my CompSci/Commerce degree in UNSW. 
It's my first summer holiday in uni and kinda boring, so I decide to upload my comp labs/ assignments/ notes to github
not only help the new students get some ideas from my codes
but also help myself doing some reivision for my whole 2019 computer science studies.
