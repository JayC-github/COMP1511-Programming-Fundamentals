# COMP1511-19T1

Hey everyone,
I'm Jay and doing my Comp/Commerce degree in UNSW now. 
It's my first summer holiday in uni and kinda boring, so I decide to upload my comp labs/ assignments/ notes to github
not only help the new students get some ideas from my codes
but also help myself doing some reivision for my whole 2019 computer science studies.
I'll also upload 1521/2521 later.
