# Pokédex and Pokémon
What is a Pokémon? What is a Pokédex?
Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon! My name is Oak! People call me the Pokémon Prof! This world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon! For some people, Pokémon are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself ... I study Pokémon as a profession. — Professor Oak

Pokémon are fictional creatures from the Pokémon franchise, most famously from the Pokémon games. The game revolves around the (questionably ethical) capturing of these creatures. Within the fiction of this universe, a device called the Pokédex is used to catalogue all the creatures a player finds and captures.
